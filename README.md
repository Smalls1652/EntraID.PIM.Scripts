# Entra ID PIM Scripts

This repo contains PowerShell scripts for automating Microsoft Entra ID Privileged Identity Management (PIM) tasks. Mainly because trying to do this through the portal is a pain in the ass.

## 💻 Scripts

All of the scripts are located in the [`Scripts/`](./Scripts/) directory and are separated based on the particular function in PIM (Entra ID roles, Groups, etc).

## 📖 Documentation

If you want to know how to run the scripts, [click here to view the documentation](./Docs/).
